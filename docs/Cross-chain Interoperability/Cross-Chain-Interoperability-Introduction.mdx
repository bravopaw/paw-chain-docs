Before setting up PAW Wallet, ensure your device meets the following requirements for smooth performance and security.

- **Install a PAW Chain-Compatible Wallet:** Ensure you have set up a wallet that supports PAW Chain (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or PAW Wallet).

- **Switch to PAW Chain Network:** In your wallet, select the PAW Chain network. This will direct you to PAW Chain’s mainnet.

- **Verify Connection:** Once connected, you can start interacting with PAW Chain, including staking, delegating, and managing your assets.
