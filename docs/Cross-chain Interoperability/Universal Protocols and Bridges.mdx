# Universal Protocols and Bridges

PAW Chain employs a series of standardized communication protocols and unique bridges allowing dApps deployed on chain the ability to interact seamlessly with other blockchains, including Solana, Tron, and EVM chains.

The bridges act as multi-signatory wallets, with validators confirming transactions on both sides to ensure secure, cross-chain asset transfers.
