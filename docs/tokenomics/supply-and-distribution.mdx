# Supply & Distribution

PAW Coin is the native token of the PAW Chain ecosystem, serving as the foundation for transactions, governance, and incentives across the network. Below are detailed sections outlining the supply as well as its distribution model

### Strategic Launch and Growth of $PAW Token {#launch}

PAW Swap deployed the $PAW token on the Ethereum mainnet on January 16, 2023, using a stealth launch approach without prior announcements. This method ensured a fair launch without pre-mining or preferential access, and set the groundwork for expanding the ecosystem across multiple chains through PAW Chain’s Layer 3 infrastructure. Following the initial launch phase, the team began expanding platform scope and functionality, leading to a rebrand to PAW Chain in late 2023 to better reflect the broader network vision.

### Building a One-Token Ecosystem {#one-token}

The $PAW coin forms the backbone of the PAW Chain ecosystem. It operates with a fixed maximum supply and integrates deflationary mechanics to gradually reduce circulating supply over time. The aim is to maintain a single-token economy that covers all core utilities within the network.

### Supply and Distribution {#supply-and-distribution}

PAW Coin serves as the native token of PAW Chain and is issued directly on the network’s Layer 3 blockchain. This architecture removes the need for third-party tokens like wrapped assets and avoids external dependency.

### Token Distribution and Security Measures {#distribution-and-security}

- **Total Supply:** 1 quadrillion PAW
- **350 trillion locked in Team Finance:** Allocated for ecosystem development, validator incentives, and platform enhancements.
- **650 trillion used for liquidity:** Paired with ETH to establish the initial liquidity pool.
- **Liquidity security:** LP tokens were sent to a burn address immediately after creation, making the liquidity pool immutable and non-custodial.
- **Deflationary mechanics:** The protocol includes transaction fees and liquidity provisioning features that systematically reduce supply over time.

PAW Coin’s design focuses on transparency, long-term sustainability, and minimizing risk through locked liquidity and on-chain verifiable supply controls.
