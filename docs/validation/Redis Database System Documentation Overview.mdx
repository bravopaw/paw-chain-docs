# Redis Database System

The Redis database system is designed for high availability, scalability, and resilience, utilizing a robust architecture comprising a master-slave replication model, automated backups, and Redis Sentinel for automatic failover management.

### Architecture Components

**1. Application Service (App)**
- Connects directly to the Redis Master node for performing all write operations.
- Connects to Redis Slave nodes primarily to perform read operations, distributing load efficiently and improving read performance.

**2. Redis Master**
- Central node responsible for handling all write operations and storing the primary dataset.
- Replicates data changes to all connected slave nodes to maintain data consistency.
- Managed by Redis Sentinel for monitoring and failover protection.

**3. Redis Slave Nodes (Slave 1-4)**
- Replicate data continuously from the Redis Master, keeping data synchronized.
- Handle read requests from the application, significantly reducing read load on the Redis Master.
- Eligible for automatic promotion to master by Redis Sentinel in case of the current master's failure.

**4. Redis Sentinel (Sentinel 1-3)**
- Continuously monitor the Redis Master for availability and health.
- Automatically initiate a failover process, selecting one of the slave nodes to promote as the new master if the original master becomes unavailable.
- Ensure minimal downtime and enhance fault tolerance.

**5. Backup Service**
- Regularly executes automated backups of the Redis Master's data.
- Provides a safeguard against data loss and enables rapid recovery in disaster scenarios.

### Workflow

- The application sends write requests exclusively to the Redis Master.
- The master processes and replicates these changes to slave nodes asynchronously.
- The application utilizes Redis Slave nodes for read operations, balancing load and improving responsiveness.
- Redis Sentinel monitors the master's availability, and upon detection of a master failure, it automatically promotes one of the slave nodes to become the new master.
- Backups are regularly scheduled, ensuring data safety and quick recovery.

### Failover Process

- Redis Sentinel continuously monitors the health and availability of the Redis Master node.
- If the Sentinel nodes detect that the master has become unresponsive, they collaborate to elect a new master from among the available Redis Slave nodes.
- This elected slave node is promoted automatically, becoming the new Redis Master, ensuring minimal downtime and seamless continuity of operations.
- The other slave nodes reconfigure themselves to replicate data from the newly promoted master.

### Benefits

- High Availability: Continuous replication and automated failover eliminate single points of failure.
- Scalability: Slave nodes distribute read operations, enabling the system to scale horizontally.
- Fault Tolerance: Automatic failover through Redis Sentinel reduces downtime.
- Data Durability: Regular automated backups protect against data loss.
