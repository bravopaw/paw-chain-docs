# Unlock Periods

When you unbond or unstake your PAW, there is a 7-day unlocking period before your tokens can be fully transferred or withdrawn. Here’s how it works:

1. **7-Day Unlock Period**: After initiating the unbonding process, your PAW coins will remain locked for 7 days. During this period, you cannot transfer or withdraw the coins, but you can track the status of the unbonding process.
2. **Pending Pool Reentry**: If a validator falls below the required self-stake, it will be placed back into the pending pool. If a locker unbonds, their PAW is also subject to the 7-day unlocking period. After this period, other lockers can take over the validator slot.
3. **Unlocking Notifications**: The system will notify all involved parties when a locker or validator begins the unbonding process, providing transparency for all users.
