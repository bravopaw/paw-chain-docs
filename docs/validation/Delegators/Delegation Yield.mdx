# Delegation Yield

When you delegate to a validator, your rewards will depend on several factors, including the validator’s stake size, downtime, and performance. Here’s a breakdown of how delegation yields work:

1. **Full Stake Validators**: Delegators to full stake validators (those who have staked the full 2.5 trillion PAW) receive 10% of the block rewards generated by the validator. This makes full stake validators an attractive choice for delegators seeking potentially stable rewards.
2. **Partial Stake Validators**: If you delegate to a validator who is in the pending pool (with less than 2.5 trillion PAW), the rewards distribution is different. Once the validator achieves the full stake, 80% of the rewards are distributed to the lockers who helped them reach the target, and 10% goes to the delegators.
3. **Locker Stakers**: Lockers who help a partial stake validator reach the required stake level will receive a significant portion of the rewards (80% for the blocks that validator signs) until the validator becomes fully staked.
4. **Rewards Claiming**: You can claim your rewards from your validator dashboard at any time. This gives you flexibility in managing your PAW holdings while participating in the network.
