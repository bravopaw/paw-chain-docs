# Choosing a Validator

When selecting a validator, it’s important to consider factors such as stake size, rewards distribution, reliability, and performance. PAW Chain offers validators that range from fully staked validators to partial stake validators. Here’s what you should know:

1. **Full Stake Validators**: Validators who have staked the full 2.5 trillion PAW receive 90% of the block rewards for the blocks they sign, with the remaining 10% distributed to their delegators. These validators tend to be more stable and committed, making them a potentially safer option for delegators.
2. **Partial Stake Validators**: Validators with less than 2.5 trillion PAW in stake can enter a pending pool. To achieve full validator status, they rely on delegators to help them reach the required stake. These validators may offer lower rewards for their blocks but can still be an option for delegators seeking lower risk.
3. **Performance**: Make sure to assess validator performance by looking at uptime and penalties. Validators that have been penalized for downtime may not be as reliable, affecting your potential rewards.
4. **Rewards and Delegation**: Understand the rewards distribution model. Full stake validators distribute 10% of rewards to delegators, while partial stake validators allocate 80% of the rewards to the lockers who helped them reach the 2.5 trillion PAW stake.
5. **Validator Reliability**: Choose validators with a strong track record of uptime and minimal penalties. Validators with too many downtime penalties can lead to a reduction in rewards or even bans, affecting your delegation.

You can browse and delegate to available validators using the PAW Validator Dashboard at [validators.pawchain.net](https://validators.pawchain.net).
