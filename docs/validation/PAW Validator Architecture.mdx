# Validator Architecture

To begin, the application must be installed on a `desktop device`.

:::danger Download the Validator Package

[`https://validator.pawchain.net/binary/paw-validator-application_1.0.0_amd64.zip`](https://validator.pawchain.net/binary/paw-validator-application_1.0.0_amd64.zip)

:::

To install and set up the validator application, follow the full setup guide [here](/validation/set-up).

## Access Token Generation

Once launched, the user can become a validator and receive a validator access token. This token is required to access and operate the application.

## Validator Availability Verification

From the wallet a transaction is sent, the system picks the validators for operations, it checks whether the validator is enabled or disabled.

Transactions pass through the validator only if the validator process is enabled. If it is disabled, transactions proceed by picking other validators.

## Block/Transaction Validation Process

A validator must be selected to validate the block and transactions. For example,

- If there are four clients, each with their own application, one validator is selected on the wallet side.
- The selected validator is broadcasted along with transaction details and validator information.
- These details are retrieved from the validator application and used to confirm whether the selected validator will process the transaction.
- The chosen validator is responsible for encoding and encrypting the transaction, which is then decrypted on the validation side.

Initially, after decryption, the validator examines the last block in their database. This block contains a hash, and based on this hash and the transaction details, an encryption hash is generated for the transaction.

## Security and Access Control

A key security feature of the application is each access token must be unique. A single access token can only be used to launch one instance of the application at a time. The same validator token cannot be used to start another instance simultaneously.

## New Authentication Process

- A unique ***appId*** is generated using the machine’s ***machineId*** upon the first installation of the validator application.
- This ***appId*** is then used to generate an authentication token (authToken) every time a socket call is initiated.
- The PAW socket server verifies the ***authToken*** before processing the request.
- If the authentication fails, the validator is immediately removed from the active validators list to prevent unauthorized access.

# Initial Application Setup and Data Import

Since the database (DB) is initially empty, data must be imported before the application can function. This can be done in two ways:

1. **Using an Existing Validator**: The user must obtain a validator ID, enter it, and click **"Fork"** to clone the database.
2. **Using the Mempool**: Entering the **Paw Chain RPC URL** and clicking `Fork`` to save data in the database.

Once the data is added, the user must click `Restart Application`. This setup process is required only during the first launch of the application

# Database Structure and Availability Approach

This approach is implemented to prevent downtime and increase system availability by ensuring continuous database operation.

### 1. Primary Components of the Validator Database

The validator database (DB) structure consists of six containers:

- Sentinel-1
- Sentinel-2
- Sentinel-3
- Master-DB
- Slave-DB-1
- Slave-DB-2

### 2. Role of Sentinels

Sentinels are responsible for monitoring and managing database availability:

- They handle database functions and determine the active database at any given time.
- If one sentinel fails, the remaining sentinels take over.
- The presence of three sentinels ensures fault tolerance and seamless failover switching.

### 3. Database Synchronization and Redundancy

- The system operates with one master database and two slave databases.
- All database instances are continuously synchronized, ensuring that every DB maintains the same data at all times.
- If the master database fails, one of the slave databases automatically becomes the new master, ensuring uninterrupted operation.

This architecture provides high availability, fault tolerance, and real-time data consistency, making the system resilient against failures.
