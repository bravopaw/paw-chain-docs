# Validator Incentive Mechanism

PAW Chain employs a cross-stitching methodology that divides validators into three levels, each performing different tasks for block confirmation. This prevents malicious behavior and ensures each block is verified twice, enhancing network security.

Validators can either fully self-stake the required 2.5 trillion PAW coins or receive delegations through lockers. Partial stake validators (starting with 10% of the required stake) are placed in a pending pool until they receive enough lockers to meet the threshold. This flexibility allows more participants to become validators and contribute to the network’s decentralization.

Full-stake validators receive 90% of the block rewards, while delegators and partial-stake validators receive a share in rewards, encouraging both validators and holders to contribute to the growth of the network.
