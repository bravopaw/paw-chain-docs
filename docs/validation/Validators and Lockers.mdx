# Validators and Lockers

## Who are lockers?

A Locker is a user or entity who stakes their PAW tokens to assist validators who do not have sufficient funds, in order to meet the required minimum stake amount. As Validators are required to meet a minimum stake amount fo 2.5 Trillion PAW, to qualify as an active validator, if a validator does not have sufficient funds to meet this requirement, **lockers** can fill the stake gap. Lockers contribute smaller stake amounts and operate under validators.

Lockers contribute their own tokens to help the validator reach the required stake amount. For example,

- If a validator needs an additional **500,000,000,000 PAW** to qualify, lockers can collectively stake this amount.
- Suppose two lockers each stake **250,000,000,000 PAW** together, they fulfill the required **500,000,000,000 PAW** gap, allowing the validator to become active.

This mechanism enables validators to operate even if they do not have the full stake amount, while lockers earn rewards based on their contributions.

The minimum staking requirement for validators has been increased to 2.5 trillion PAW tokens.

- **Full Stake Validators**: Validators who meet the full 2.5 trillion PAW stake are considered fully active and receive `90%` of the block rewards.
- **Partial Stake Validators**: Validators with less than 2.5 trillion PAW can start with a minimum stake of `10%` of the required amount. They must receive delegations to reach the full stake requirement before they become fully active validators.

Validators who fall below the required self-stake will be placed back into the pending pool, and their status will change accordingly.

## Locker Yield

Lockers earn rewards based on the amount of PAW they stake and the success of the validator to whom they delegate. The yield is directly tied to the validator’s performance and the amount of staking power provided by the locker. For validators with partial stakes, the locker’s contribution is essential for the validator to meet the 2.5 trillion PAW stake requirement. Once the validator reaches the required stake, lockers earn a share of the rewards generated by that validator, with `80%` of the rewards distributed to lockers for helping the validator meet the requirement.

## Unlock Period

The Unlock Period (also known as the “Unbonding Time” or “Cool Down Period”) refers to the duration a locker must wait after initiating the unbonding process before their staked PAW tokens can be fully withdrawn. This period is set at 7 days. If a locker decides to unbond and withdraw their tokens, they must wait for the 7-day period to pass. During this time, the validator they were delegated to will notify other lockers about the pending unbonding. After the 7-day unlock period, the locker’s PAW tokens become available for withdrawal, and the validator may be returned to the pending pool.

### **Updated Validator Unstake Logic**

The validator unstake process follows a two-step approach:

## Step 1: Unlocking the Staked Amount

- Validators can initiate the unlock process through the PAW wallet.
You can manage staking directly at [wallet.pawchain.net](https://wallet.pawchain.net).
- If a validator has not completed 14 days as a validator, a `10%` penalty is deducted from their staked amount.
- The deducted penalty amount is transferred to the PAW Treasury.
- If the validator has exceeded 14 days, no penalty is applied.
- Once unlocked, validators must wait 7 days before being able to unstake their tokens.
- A countdown timer will be displayed in the PAW wallet for tracking the waiting period.

## Step 2: Unstaking

- After the 7-day waiting period, the unstake button will be enabled in the PAW wallet.
- Validators can then proceed to unstake and retrieve their tokens back into their wallet.

## Special Scenario: Validator at Risk of Deselecting

- If a locker, staking under a validator, unlocks their staked amount, and causes the validator’s total stake to drop below the required 2.5 trillion, a warning notification will be displayed.
- The warning informs the validator that they will be deselected after 7 days if they fail to restore the required staking amount.
- The validator has 7 days to restake and meet the minimum stake requirement displayed in the warning section.
- If they fail to restake, they will automatically be removed as a validator.

### **Lockers' Unstake Logic**

The unstake process for lockers follows the same procedure as validators. 
Lockers can manage staking, unlocking, and unstaking operations at [validator.pawchain.net](https://validator.pawchain.net).

### **Penalty System Updates**

All penalty deductions are now recorded in a separate repository for better tracking and management.

To ensure network efficiency and reliability, PAW Chain imposes penalties on validators for downtime or failures:

- **Downtime Penalty**: Validators who are offline for an hour during a block processing incur a 1 billion PAW fine.
- **Checkpoint Penalty**: Missing two penalty checkpoints (24 hours) results in a temporary ban and a 10 billion PAW fine.
- **Consecutive Ban Penalty**: Accumulating 10 consecutive bans leads to a 250 billion PAW fine and a 30-day suspension from the pending pool. After the suspension, the validator must enter the pending pool again for re-approval.

Lockers who delegate to a validator are also penalized along with the validator for downtime or infractions. Delegators are not penalized if their validator goes offline but will incur a `0.25%` fine if their validator is banned.

### Validator Status Logging and Penalty System

Validators are monitored at every block. If a validator is offline for an hour during a block, they incur a fine of 1 billion PAW per hour. If a validator’s stake falls below the required threshold due to fines, they must replenish their stake to remain active.
