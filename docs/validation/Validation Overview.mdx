# Validation Overview

PAW Wallet is designed to manage the crucial process of handling transactions securely and efficiently, with a streamlined system involving a validator application, a Mempool repository, and a series of procedural steps to ensure transactions are processed accurately. This document provides a detailed explanation of the PAW Wallet validator system, outlining how transactions are initiated, validated and recorded on the blockchain.

## Overview of the PAW Wallet Transaction Flow

### The PAW Wallet transaction process involves several key stages: initiating a transaction, validating it, and updating the blockchain:

1. **Initiate Transaction:** When a user sends a transaction request, the data is first stored temporarily in a Mempool. Unlike other blockchains, transactions in the PAW  Mempool are “pre confirmed” meaning a user can’t even attempt to double spend their funds, due to the balance updating immediately to show the funds spent at time of submission.  A validator is then selected based on their staked amount, along with other factors such as ping and location.

2. **Validator Processing:** The selected validator network checks the transaction data, updates the ledger and blockchain, and sends a response back to PAW Chain.

3. **Update and Synchronize:** Depending on the outcome of the validation, the blockchain is either updated, or any failures are recorded. The system then synchronizes with the validator to keep current.
