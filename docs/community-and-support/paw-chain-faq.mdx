# PAW Chain FAQ

### **General Questions**

**What is PAW Chain?**
PAW Chain is a custom-built, decentralized Unification Blockchain network designed for scalability, efficiency, and seamless integration with multiple chains. Its native coin is $PAW, which powers the ecosystem.

**What makes PAW Chain unique?**

PAW Chain supports Multichain interoperability, is permissionless, free to use, and operates with revolutionary Layer 3 technology, enabling a single liquidity pool to support the ecosystem. It is the fastest blockchain, with transaction speeds as low as 0.004 seconds, and it offers infinitely scalable solutions.

One of PAW Chain's key strengths is that projects built on the network can have their assets accessible across the network of connected blockchains. This means that investors holding assets in Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Base, Binance Smart Chain (BNB), and others can come to PAW Swap and easily buy assets on PAW Chain using their native tokens, greatly expanding the accessibility and liquidity for projects on the network.

This is all done with one liquidity pool and is free and permissionless to use.
