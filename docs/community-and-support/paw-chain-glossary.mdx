The **PAW Chain Glossary of Terms** provides definitions for key concepts, blockchain terminology, and PAW Chain-specific mechanisms. Whether you are a developer, validator, or community member, this glossary will help you navigate the PAW Chain ecosystem and its multichain capabilities.

This glossary includes terms related to staking, validation, governance, security, and multichain interoperability, ensuring a clear understanding of how PAW Chain operates and interacts with the broader crypto space.

- **AMA (Ask Me Anything)** – A community engagement event where the PAW Chain team answers questions from the public.
- **Arbitrum (ARB)** – A Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that PAW Chain supports for multichain deployments.
- **Avalanche (AVAX)** – A high-performance blockchain supported by PAW Chain for multichain functionality.
- **All-time high / All-time low (ATH/ATL)**  – This term refers to the highest or lowest price ever reached by a given asset.
- **Altcoins** – An altcoin refers to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Each altcoin has its own set of rules, properties, and specific use cases. They may introduce new technologies or be forks of existing cryptocurrencies.

### **B**

- **Base (BASE)** – A Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain supported by PAW Chain.
- **Bear market** –  A bear market is the opposite of a bull market, where outlooks are negative as market prices trend downward.
- **Block** – A collection of transactions that are grouped together and added to the blockchain.
- **Blockchain** – A blockchain is a decentralized method of storing data, where information is duplicated and distributed across a network of computer systems. Operated by a community of miners or validators, blockchains function without a centralized intermediary.  Each block contains a cryptographic reference to the previous one, making it impossible to alter the blockchain's history.
- **Block Reward** – When miners or validators create new blocks, they receive a block reward in the form of newly minted cryptocurrency. This incentivizes participants to help maintain the blockchain.
- **BNB Chain (BNB)** – A blockchain network supported by PAW Chain for multichain deployment.

If a block is missed by the Validator, then the reward isn't distributed.
- **Consensus** – In cryptocurrencies, consensus refers to the method by which blockchain participants agree on what should be included in the blockchain. The most prominent consensus mechanisms are proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.
- **Cooldown Period** – Also known as "Unbonding," refers to the period one must wait from the time they un-stake with a Validator to the time their assets appear in their wallet. This length of time will be predetermined by the development team. There are both detriments and benefits to short Cooldown periods and long Cooldown periods.
- **Cronos (CRO)** – A blockchain supported by PAW Chain for multichain interactions.
- **Cross-Stitching** – PAW Chain’s methodology for selecting and verifying validators across multiple levels to enhance security.
