# PAW Chain Fee Structure

At PAW Chain, we’ve designed a fee structure with a strong focus on affordability, sustainability, and long-term growth. Our goal is to create a balanced system that provides value to users while ensuring that the network remains economically viable and deflationary.

While many blockchains, like Solana, operate on an inflationary model with token rewards paid to validators, PAW Chain’s deflationary model ensures that the fees collected go directly towards strengthening the PAW token and supporting network operations, without inflating the token supply. This approach rewards validators for their role in maintaining the network while also promoting the long-term stability of the PAW token.

Instead of increasing token supply, PAW Chain uses transaction fees to enhance liquidity, compensate validators, and fund future development, creating a healthier ecosystem that supports all participants.

## Fee Categories and Structure {#fee-categories}

PAW Chain fees are structured to adjust based on transaction volume, providing lower fees for higher volume transactions. This scalability is a core component of our fee structure, allowing users to benefit as the platform grows. The breakdown is as follows:

### Transaction Fees {#transaction-fees}

- **Standard Fee:** Starting at `0.5%` of the transaction amount, the fee decreases progressively as volume grows, ensuring cost savings for high-volume users.
- **Maximum Fee:** Fees are capped at `$25.00` per transaction to ensure that no matter how large the transaction, users can expect a fair maximum fee.

As the network scales, the fee will decrease:

- At **$500 Million in volume**, the fee will drop to `0.3%`.

This ensures that both small and large transactions are treated fairly, with the percentage fee dropping as the volume increases.

### Bridging Fees {#bridging-fees}

PAW Chain offers competitive bridging fees, designed to lower the cost as transaction volume increases. These fees apply when transferring assets from other chains onto PAW Chain.

- **Bridging-In Fee:**
  - Minimum: `$2.50`
  - Maximum: `$25.00`
  - Percentage Fee: Decreases from `0.5%` to `0.3%` as transaction volumes increase.
- **Bridging-Out Fee:**
  - Minimum: `$5.00`
  - Maximum: `$50.00`
  - Percentage Fee: Decreases from `1%` to `0.5%` as transaction volumes increase.

### Liquidity Fees {#liquidity-fees}

Liquidity providers play a crucial role in PAW Chain, and we have structured the liquidity fees to support both the network and LP providers.

- **Liquidity Fee:**
  - Minimum: `$5.00`
  - Maximum: `$25.00`
  - Fee decreases from `0.5%` to `0.3%` as transaction volumes increase.

### Swap Fees {#swap-fees}

When using PAW Chain’s swap utility, users will encounter fees based on the dollar volume of transactions. These fees are split between the platform’s treasury and liquidity providers.

- **Initial Swap Fee:** Starting at `0.5%`, the fee will reduce to `0.4%` as PAW Chain's ecosystem expands.
- **Fee Distribution:** The liquidity provider will receive a consistent percentage of the fee, while the treasury's share will decrease gradually to allow for greater support of the ecosystem.

### MetaMask Gas Fees for Bridging {#metamask-fees}

When users bridge tokens into PAW Chain, MetaMask’s gas fees will apply for the initial transaction. However, there’s an additional cost for sending the tokens back to the chain, which is not accounted for in MetaMask’s initial fee display. This extra fee is necessary for the finalization of the bridging process on PAW Chain. Users should consider both the initial and return transaction costs when performing bridging activities.

### Fee Roadmap and Scaling {#fee-roadmap}

The PAW Chain fee structure has been carefully designed to adapt as the platform scales. As we see higher transaction volumes, our fees will decrease, ensuring that the cost for users remains competitive.

### Volume-Based Fee Reductions {#volume-based-reductions}

The structure uses a progressive scale where the fees decrease as transaction volume increases. Below is a simplified example:

- For transactions ranging from `$0` to `$500,000`, the fee percentage starts at `0.5%`.
- As volumes surpass `$500 million`, the fee percentage drops to `0.3%`, with a capped maximum fee of `$25`.

These reductions provide substantial savings as PAW Chain’s ecosystem grows, rewarding high-volume users.

### Upcoming Phased Implementation {#phased-fee-implementation}

We are in the process of gradually implementing the new fee structure as part of the ongoing development of PAW Chain. This phased rollout will ensure that users and projects can adjust smoothly to the changes while preserving the integrity of the network’s operations.

The PAW Chain team has worked diligently to ensure that the new fee structure is both sustainable and competitive with other platforms. By aligning fees with the network's transaction volume, we can provide long-term value to all participants in the ecosystem.
