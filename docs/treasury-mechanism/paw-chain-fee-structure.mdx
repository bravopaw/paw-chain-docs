# PAW Chain Fee Structure

At PAW Chain, we’ve designed a fee structure with a strong focus on affordability, sustainability, and long-term growth. Our goal is to create a balanced system that provides value to users while ensuring that the network remains economically viable and deflationary.

While many blockchains, like Solana, operate on an inflationary model with token rewards paid to validators, PAW Chain’s deflationary model ensures that the fees collected go directly towards strengthening the PAW token and supporting network operations, without inflating the token supply. This approach rewards validators for their role in maintaining the network while also promoting the long-term stability of the PAW token.

Instead of increasing token supply, PAW Chain uses transaction fees to enhance liquidity, compensate validators, and fund ongoing development, creating a healthier ecosystem that supports all participants.

## Fee Categories and Structure {#fee-categories}

PAW Chain fees are structured to provide fairness and sustainability across different transaction types. The breakdown is as follows:

### Transaction Fees {#transaction-fees}

- **Standard Fee:** `0.5%` of the transaction amount.
- **Maximum Fee:** Fees are capped at `$25.00` per transaction to ensure that no matter how large the transaction, users can expect a fair maximum fee.

This ensures that both small and large transactions are treated fairly under the same structure.

### Bridging Fees {#bridging-fees}

PAW Chain offers competitive bridging fees that support the network’s operational costs and liquidity.

- **Bridging-In Fee:**
  - Minimum: `$2.50`
  - Maximum: `$25.00`
  - Percentage Fee: `0.5%` per bridging transaction
- **Bridging-Out Fee:**
  - Minimum: `$5.00`
  - Maximum: `$50.00`
  - Percentage Fee: `1%` per bridging transaction

### Liquidity Fees {#liquidity-fees}

Liquidity providers play a crucial role in PAW Chain, and we have structured the liquidity fees to support both the network and LP providers.

- **Liquidity Fee:**
  - Minimum: `$5.00`
  - Maximum: `$25.00`
  - Percentage Fee: `0.5%` per liquidity transaction

### Swap Fees {#swap-fees}

When using PAW Chain’s swap utility, users will encounter fees based on the dollar volume of transactions. These fees are split between the platform’s treasury and liquidity providers.

- **Swap Fee:** `0.5%` per transaction
- **Fee Distribution:** The liquidity provider receives a consistent percentage of the fee, while the treasury’s share supports ongoing network development.

### MetaMask Gas Fees for Bridging {#metamask-fees}

When users bridge tokens into PAW Chain, MetaMask’s gas fees will apply for the initial transaction. However, there’s an additional cost for sending the tokens back to the chain, which is not accounted for in MetaMask’s initial fee display. This extra fee is necessary for the finalization of the bridging process on PAW Chain. Users should consider both the initial and return transaction costs when performing bridging activities.

## Fee Policy Overview {#fee-policy-overview}

The PAW Chain fee structure has been designed to remain stable and transparent over time. Our current fee levels reflect the economic model we’ve established to support the network’s operations, validators, and ecosystem participants.
