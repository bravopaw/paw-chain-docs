# Accessing PAW Chain Mainnet {#access-mainnet}

```


Before setting up **PAW Wallet**, ensure your device meets the following requirements for smooth performance and security.

- **Install PAW Wallet**  
  PAW Chain is a non-EVM network and cannot be accessed through external wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. You must use the official **PAW Wallet** to connect to the network.

- **Connect to PAW Chain**  
  Once logged into PAW Wallet, the PAW Chain mainnet is already integrated — there is no need to manually switch networks.

- **Verify Connection**  
  After opening the wallet, you will be connected to the PAW Chain mainnet. You can now interact with PAW Chain features including `staking`, `delegating`, and `asset management`.
