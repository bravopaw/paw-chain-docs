### **Optional Step: Add Tokens to Wallet:**
 *After swapping, if you cannot see the new token in your wallet, you may need to manually add it as a custom token. To do this, find the token’s contract address using the PAW Chain scanner, and then add it to your wallet under the “Custom Token” section. This will allow you to view the balance of your newly acquired tokens.*

- In the PAW Scanner, click on `Tokens` in the top right.
