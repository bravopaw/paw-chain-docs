# Node.js & Typescript Core

### Typescript

The following example highlights PAW Chain’s real use of TypeScript, shown here in a code block for clarity.

```js title="PAW Typescript Core"
export default async function createConfigAsync() {
  return {
    title: 'PAW Chain',
    language: 'TypeScript',
    description:
      'PAW Chain utilizes the TypeScript programming language for its core blockchain logic, providing enhanced code quality, scalability, maintainability, and early bug detection.',
    url: 'https://pawchain.net',
    // TypeScript in action
  };
}
```

### Node.js

PAW Chain uses Node.js for network operations; optimizing network layer performance, and improving transaction speed and efficiency. Node.js allows for the efficient management of simultaneous connections, known as asynchronous I/O (input/output), so multiple transactions can be processed at once.

Node.js also enables PAW Chain to operate across different operating systems, allowing for a wider range of validators to participate, by making it possible for a validator node to be set up on any operating systems.

Similarly, these documentation pages are also built using Node.js, alongside TypeScript, React, MDX (Markdown with JSX), and CSS.
