# Redis-Powered Blockchain Ledger

**PAW Chain** uses `Redis` data stores as its core blockchain ledger. Redis allows for blocks to be stored directly in memory, enabling fast access and ultra-low confirmation times across the network.

As of now, all blocks are held in memory to maximise performance. A future upgrade will introduce a hybrid model — storing recent blocks in memory while archiving older blocks to disk for long-term scalability.

The network also employs `edge routing` to dynamically select validators with the lowest latency, further improving confirmation speed and overall user responsiveness.

- When a user performs a task on PAWChain with an application, requiring validation, the application communicates to the master through the sentinels.
- The master oversees the validation, and the Redis backup performs a backup of the masters logs.
- If the sentinels see that the master fails, they promote a slave as the new master.
- The backup loads the memory of the old master to the new master, and validations continue through the new master.
- Each slave is monitored against the master to ensure no dissimilarity is detected.
