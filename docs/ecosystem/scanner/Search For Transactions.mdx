# Search for Transactions

## i. Accessing PAW Scanner

Open your preferred browser and visit: `https://scanner.pawchain.net`

## ii. Using the Search Bar

If you have a specific `transaction hash` or token to search for:

- Enter the hash in the **search bar** at the top of the page
- Press **Enter** on your keyboard to initiate the search

## Additional: Browsing Transaction History

If you don’t have a hash, you can manually scroll through recent transaction history on the **PAW Scanner** homepage.

This is useful for locating recent transfers, swaps, or liquidity events.

## Additional: L3 Transactions

- At the top right of the homepage, next to the displayed `PAW Price`, click the **Transactions** button
- This will open a new page showing recent **Layer 3** transactions on **PAW Chain**
