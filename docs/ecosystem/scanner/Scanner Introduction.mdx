# Introduction to PAW Scanner

**PAW Scanner** is **PAW Chain’s** dedicated transaction and token explorer. Similar to tools like **Etherscan**, **BaseScan**, and **Polyscan**, it displays detailed blockchain activity from platforms like **PAW Wallet** and **PAW Swap**.

Whenever a swap, transfer, or liquidity action occurs, the transaction details are made visible on **PAW Scanner**.

Unlike traditional scanners, **PAW Scanner** preserves **PAW Chain’s** native privacy features — meaning users cannot view the contents of a **PAW Wallet** unless that wallet has explicitly enabled the automatic privacy setting within the wallet interface.

## Key Features

- Search transactions by `transaction hash`
- Monitor the real-time `PAW price`
- View total `transaction count`, `block history`, and `wallet count`
- Check the live number of `Validator nodes`
- Additional metrics for tracking on-chain activity

**PAW Scanner** brings visibility and transparency to the network while maintaining the privacy-first foundation of **PAW Chain**.
