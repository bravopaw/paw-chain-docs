## iv. Choose a Token

Clicking a token from the list opens its dedicated token page. This page includes:

- `Maximum supply`
- `Number of holders`
- `Transfer count`
- `Current price`
- `On-chain market cap`
- `Creator wallet address`
- `Token program address`
- `Tax settings`
- `Recent transactions`

Use the search bar on the token’s page to search transaction history by `transaction hash`.

Below the search field, you’ll find four interactive tabs:

1. **Transactions** – View token activity
2. **Holder Percentages** – See distribution stats
   - Wallet addresses will not display for any account with privacy mode enabled
3. **Transfers** – View individual transfers of the token
4. **Program & Contract** – Inspect associated technical details
