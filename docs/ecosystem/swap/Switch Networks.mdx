# Switching Blockchain Networks in PAW Swap

## Switching Between Networks

This guide explains how to switch between **EVM** and **non-EVM** blockchains inside **PAW Swap**. By changing networks within the swap interface, users can seamlessly prepare for cross-chain trades without needing to leave the platform.

## i. Access the PAW Swap Interface

Open your in-app browser or preferred device and visit: `https://swap.pawchain.net`

## ii. Locate the Network Selector

In the top right corner of the screen, you'll see a dropdown showing the currently selected network (e.g. `Ethereum`).

## iii. Open the Network Dropdown

Click the dropdown arrow to reveal a list of supported networks.

## iv. Select Your Desired Network

Scroll through the list and click on the network you wish to connect to.
This will trigger a prompt in your connected wallet for confirmation.

## v. Confirm the Network Switch

Approve the request in your wallet to complete the network switch.
**PAW Swap** will now operate using the selected chain for upcoming actions.

## Tips

- Always verify the active network before initiating swaps or bridging
- Make sure your wallet has sufficient balance to cover `gas fees` on the new network
- Switching networks may refresh the session in some browsers or wallets
