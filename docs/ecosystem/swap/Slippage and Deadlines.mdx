# Setting Slippage on PAW Swap {#set-slippage}

## Understanding Slippage

This guide walks you through how to set slippage when performing a token swap on **PAW Swap**. Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price executed. Setting the right slippage helps ensure your transaction goes through smoothly without failing due to price fluctuations.

### Price Fluctuations in Slippage

Price fluctuations refer to changes in token price between the moment you start a transaction and when it is confirmed on-chain. This is common in volatile markets.

For example, if you attempt to swap a token priced at `$1.00`, but it rises to `$1.05` before confirmation, the transaction may fail if your slippage tolerance is set too low (e.g. `0.5%`).

Setting slippage too low may result in failed trades. Too high, and you risk overpaying.

## i. Accessing the Slippage Settings

- On the **PAW Swap** interface, locate the **cog icon** in the top right of the swap UI.
- Click it to open the settings menu.

## ii. Viewing Default Slippage

- You will see a default slippage setting of `0.5%`.

## iii. Adjusting Slippage

- Click the **Custom** tab to enter your own slippage percentage.

## iv. When to Adjust Slippage

- `0.1% – 0.5%`: For stable, high-liquidity tokens
- `0.5% – 2%`: For moderately volatile assets
- `Above 2%`: For high volatility tokens or large orders

## v. Setting Your Custom Slippage

- Enter your desired slippage percentage.
- Confirm to apply the setting.

## vi. Completing Your Swap

- Continue your swap — your selected slippage will apply automatically.

## Additional Tips

- Avoid using extremely high slippage percentages.
- If a swap fails repeatedly, increase slippage slightly until it succeeds.

# Setting Transaction Deadlines on PAW Swap {#transaction-deadlines}

## Understanding Transaction Deadlines

This section covers how to set transaction deadlines on **PAW Swap**. A transaction deadline is the maximum time a swap can remain pending before it’s cancelled automatically.

Transaction deadlines are measured in **minutes**. If a transaction isn't confirmed within that time, it will be cancelled — helping avoid stuck swaps during congestion.

For example, if you set a deadline of `20` minutes and the swap doesn’t confirm in time, the trade is cancelled and funds remain untouched.

## i. Accessing the Transaction Deadline Settings

- On the **PAW Swap** interface, click the **cog icon** in the top right to open the settings menu.

## ii. Viewing Default Transaction Deadline

- The default setting is `10` minutes.

## iii. Adjusting the Transaction Deadline

- Input your desired time (in minutes) in the **Transaction Deadline** field.

## iv. When to Adjust the Deadline

- **High congestion**: Increase the deadline to avoid failed swaps.
- **Fast networks**: Use a shorter deadline to avoid outdated swaps.

## v. Setting Your Custom Deadline

- Enter the time value you prefer.
- Confirm your settings to apply the change.

## vi. Completing Your Swap

- Continue with your transaction — the deadline setting will apply automatically.

## Additional Tips

- Avoid short deadlines during busy times.
- Watch current network speed and congestion levels.
- Always verify your settings before confirming a swap.
