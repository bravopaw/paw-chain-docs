# What is PAW Swap?

**PAW Swap** is the external, non-**PAW Wallet** cross-chain trading platform built for the **PAW Chain** ecosystem. While users can perform swaps directly inside the **PAW Wallet**, **PAW Swap** enables the same functionality for those who prefer not to use a dedicated wallet.

Users can connect their wallet of choice — such as **MetaMask**, **Coinbase Wallet**, **Phantom Wallet**, and others — to **PAW Swap**. They can then trade assets directly from their chosen wallet or initiate a swap and have the resulting assets sent to their **PAW Wallet**.

All swaps executed through **PAW Wallet** are handled exclusively on **PAW Chain**. However, when a swap is performed via **PAW Swap**, the asset first bridges from its host chain to **PAW Chain**. The trade is then executed on **PAW Chain**’s high-speed Layer 3 infrastructure (`4ms` transaction time), before the final asset is bridged back to the receiving chain. Off-chain movements remain subject to the transaction speeds of the respective host and destination chains.

Both swap methods retain full compatibility with **PAW Chain**’s security architecture. **PAW Swap** adds an extra layer of protection by performing randomised security checks during cross-chain swaps.

For users looking to swap directly within **PAW Wallet**, see [PAW Swap Lite](/ecosystem/wallet/perform-in-wallet-swap), our in-wallet implementation of **PAW Swap**.

`PAW Swap Pro`, our upcoming release, will introduce a full DeFi experience that brings CEX-like features to decentralised cross-chain trading.
