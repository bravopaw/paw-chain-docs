# What are .paw Usernames?

`.paw` usernames are personalised identifiers within the **PAW Chain** ecosystem, similar in function to **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**. They let users replace long, complex wallet addresses with simple, memorable tags — like `john.paw` — improving usability and reducing the risk of sending funds to the wrong address.

These usernames are fully integrated across all major **PAW Chain** platforms, including **PAW Wallet**, **PAW Swap**, and **PAW Scanner**.

## Registration and Ownership

Users can check and register a `.paw` username directly within **PAW Wallet**.

### Pricing (Approximate)

- `3-letter`: `$100 USD`
- `4–5 letters`: `$50 USD`
- `6+ letters`: `$25 USD`

Usernames require `annual renewal`. A secondary market is in development to allow multi-year purchases, renewals, and future transfers between users.

Each `.paw` username is securely mapped to a user's wallet address on-chain, offering verifiable ownership and full flexibility to update or transfer the name as needed.

# How to Create a Custom .paw Username in PAW Wallet

Creating a custom `.paw` username in **PAW Wallet** is quick and straightforward. Instead of long wallet addresses, `.paw` usernames provide a clean and recognisable way to send and receive assets across the **PAW Chain** network.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### i. Access the Wallet UI

Open your **PAW Wallet** to reach the main interface.

### ii. Open the Address Settings

At the top of the screen, tap on your wallet address shown inside a blue box.
This will open a dropdown menu.

### iii. Navigate to Settings

In the dropdown, select **Settings**.

### iv. Select "Wallet Username"

Inside the settings screen, tap **Wallet Username** to proceed.

### v. Enter Your Desired Username

Type in your preferred `.paw` username.
The system will check availability to ensure it's not already taken.

### vi. Save Your Username

Once confirmed, save your selection to complete the process.

## Tips for Choosing Your Username

- Make it memorable and easy to spell
- Avoid unnecessary characters or complexity
- Shorter usernames incur higher registration fees due to demand
- There is a one-time processing fee when creating or updating a `.paw` name
