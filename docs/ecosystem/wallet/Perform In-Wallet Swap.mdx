# How to Perform an In-Wallet Swap

## i. Accessing PAW Wallet

Open your in-app wallet browser and visit: `https://wallet.pawchain.net`

## ii. Connect Your Wallet

Click the **Disconnected** button in the top-right corner of **PAW Wallet**, next to your wallet address.

Choose your preferred wallet — such as **MetaMask**, **WalletConnect**, or another supported provider.

Follow the prompts to approve and connect your wallet to **PAW Wallet**.

## iii. Selecting a Network

In the pop-up window, select the network on which you wish to perform the swap.

## iv. Select the Swap Function

Below your displayed PAW balance and valuation, press the **Swap** button.

## v. Select the Token to Swap

In the **From** dropdown menu, choose the token you want to swap from your **PAW Wallet**.

## vi. Select the Token to Receive

In the **To** dropdown menu, select the token you want to receive.

## vii. Enter the Amount

- In the **Amount** field, input how much of the token you want to swap.  
- You’ll see the equivalent value of the receiving token calculated based on live market rates.

## viii. Review Transaction Details

Review the displayed `exchange rate`, `transaction fee`, and `minimum received` amount carefully.

## ix. Swap Assets

Click **Swap** to continue.

A confirmation pop-up will appear — approve it to finalise the transaction.

## x. Wait for Transaction Confirmation

Swaps within **PAW Wallet** typically complete in `under one second`.  
Once confirmed, your received token will appear on your home screen under **Tokens**.

## xi. Check Your Wallet

After the swap completes, verify that the expected token has been received and is displayed correctly in your wallet.
