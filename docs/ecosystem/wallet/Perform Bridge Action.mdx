# How to Perform a Bridge Action

## i. Accessing PAW Wallet

Open your in-app wallet browser and visit: `https://wallet.pawchain.net`

## ii. Connect Your Wallet

Click the **Disconnected** button in the top-right corner of the PAW Wallet, next to your **PAW Wallet address**.

Choose your preferred wallet — such as **MetaMask**, **WalletConnect**, or another supported provider.

Follow the prompts to approve and connect your wallet to **PAW Wallet**.

## iii. Select a Network

In the pop-up window inside **PAW Wallet**, choose the network from which you want to bridge an asset.

## iv. Select the Bridge Function

Below your PAW balance display, click the **Bridge** button.
Then choose either **Bridge In** or **Bridge Out** at the top of the interface.

## v. Select the Token to Bridge

In the **From** dropdown menu, select the token you wish to bridge:
- For **Bridge In**: from your connected wallet
- For **Bridge Out**: from your **PAW Wallet**

## vi. Enter the Amount

- In the **Amount** field, input the number of tokens to bridge.
- If bridging out, enter the destination wallet address in the **Pay To** field.

## vii. Review Bridge Details

The UI will display the `exchange rate`, `transaction fee`, and `minimum received`.
Review all details carefully before proceeding.

## viii. Bridge Approval

If this is your first time bridging a specific token, click **Approve**.
This allows the bridge contract to access the token in your wallet.

- Confirm the approval in the **PAW Wallet** pop-up.
- Confirm again in your connected wallet interface.

Once approved, click **Bridge** to continue.

A confirmation pop-up will appear — confirm it to submit the transaction.

## ix. Wait for Bridge Confirmation

- A **Bridge In** usually reflects in your PAW Wallet within a few seconds.
- You’ll receive a confirmation and the token will appear under **Tokens** on the wallet home screen.

:::note

**Bridge Out** actions currently include a `12-hour` security hold before release.

## x. Check Your Wallet

Once the bridge process completes, open your wallet and verify that the tokens have been received.
