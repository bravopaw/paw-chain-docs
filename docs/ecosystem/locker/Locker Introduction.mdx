# PAW Locker Features

**PAW Locker** is a utility platform designed to improve transparency and trust in token ecosystems built on **PAW Chain**. It offers tools that support security, fairness, and operational efficiency — helping both developers and communities manage assets responsibly.

## Liquidity Locks

Token projects can create `liquidity locks` to secure their liquidity pool assets.
This reduces the risk of **rug pulls** and provides assurance to the token's community that liquidity cannot be suddenly withdrawn.

- Helps protect early holders
- Boosts credibility of new token launches
- Locks are verifiable on-chain via **PAW Scanner**

## Team Token Locks *(coming soon)*

Team token locks will allow developers to lock portions of their token supply to show long-term commitment and reduce the risk of early sell-offs.

- Adds transparency around team allocations
- Builds trust through scheduled unlocks
- Useful for vesting and milestone-based releases

## Multisender *(coming soon)*

**Multisender** will enable sending tokens to multiple **PAW Wallet** addresses in a single transaction.

- Ideal for airdrops, community rewards, and bulk distributions
- May include support for CSV uploads or similar batch tools
- Designed to reduce time and cost associated with large-scale transfers

**PAW Locker** plays a key role in the **PAW Chain** ecosystem by making early-stage token management more secure, verifiable, and community-friendly.
